## Introduction to NumPy
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library for numerical computations in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions to operate on these data structures efficiently. NumPy is widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing.

Key Features:
- **N-dimensional arrays**: Efficient storage and manipulation of large datasets.
- **Mathematical functions**: Fast operations on arrays, including linear algebra, statistics, and more.
- **Broadcasting**: Performing operations on arrays of different shapes.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with other libraries like Pandas, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
